# Hello!

I am a recent BSc Computer Science and MSc Artificial Intelligence graduate with a strong technical foundation. Throughout my studies, I have accumulated a diverse skill set and am now both excited and eager to apply it to solving real-world challenges. I thrive on innovation, creativity, and intuitive problem-solving, ready to make a meaningful impact in the field of technology.

## Projects

> Here are some of my projects I think you might be interested in.

|Automated Object Handling with UR5e 6-DoF Robotic Arm|
|-------------------|
|I created a hybrid behaviour algorithm that operates the robotic arm to identify objects, handle these objects, and then drop them into a specified location, this behaviour model enables both deliberative and reactive capabilities. Check out the full implementation [here](https://gitfront.io/r/hongd13/wD3oN5qJpZXR/Robotic-Arm/ "Robotic Arm Repo")!|

|Optimisation of Cutting Stock Problem Using Evolutionary Algorithms|
|-------------------|
|Conventionally, optimisation algorithm design often favours elitism and sees it as an obvious choice of technique. However, inspired by "Talent versus Luck" by Pluchino et al., this project proves, that contrary to traditional elitism, equal investment of resources in opportunities can yield just as good if not better outcomes. See the project in details [here](https://gitfront.io/r/hongd13/vUKqKJ8xGxK5/Cutting-Stock-Problem/ "Cutting Stock Problem Repo").|

|Chagasâ€™ Disease Detection with Machine Learning|
|-------------------|
|This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect the presence of Chagas' disease in patients, using a high complexity Linear B-cell epitopes dataset. The machine learning model achieved a 97% recall of positive patients. Checkout the full development process and results [here](https://gitfront.io/r/hongd13/eruzBBDSHoa7/Chagas-Disease-Prediction/ "Chagas' Disease Detection Repo").|
